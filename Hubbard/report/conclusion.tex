\section{Conclusion and outlook}

We are convinced that the performance could be significantly improved by calculating the matrix multiplication, the inverse and maybe even the determinant once in advance with variables and then just insert the values for $\phi$ each time. Unfortunately we don't know how to do this in R.
The plots where we calculated the partition function for increasing $N_t$, look all similar. A function like $Z_0(1-1/N_t)$ could maybe be fitted to the reachable values of $N_t$ to estimate the real result of $Z$.
