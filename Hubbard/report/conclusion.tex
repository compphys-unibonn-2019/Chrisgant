\section{Conclusion and outlook}
Most of our plots confirm clearly that the Hubbard-Stratanovic Transformation in combination with Monte-Carlo integration is capable of calculating the partition function and expectation values for the Hubbard model. Although performance issues forced us to keep the lattice small, we are confident that our method has great potential with a few enhancements. 

We are convinced that the performance could be significantly improved by calculating the matrix multiplication, the inverse and maybe even the determinant once in advance with variables and then just insert the values for $\phi$ each time. Unfortunately we don't know how to do this in R.
The plots where we calculated the partition function for increasing $N_t$, look all similar. A function like $Z_0(1-1/N_t)$ could maybe be fitted to the reachable values of $N_t$ to estimate the real result of $Z$.
