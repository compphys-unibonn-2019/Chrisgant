Even though the Hubbard model is a highly simplified model for the dynamics of electrons in matter, it gives rise to a variety of interesting physics such as the transition between metal and insulator, antiferromagnetism and even superconductivity. It is therefore worth studying.\\
In this work we investigate the onedimensional Hubbard model using Monte Carlo integration methods. Following two different techniques, we first implement a Metropolis algorithm and secondly use a Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation \cite{luu} to be able to perform a suitable path integral over all Fock states. We aim to calculate the correlation functions and compare them to the analytical results for small lattices.
